*__Update:__ I've posted a [new entry][newentry] covering the creation of my new site!*

I finally have a new blog!  I'm working on new posts right now, and will have lots of content up soon.  I
am also still tweaking the design (this is currently the default template).  In the first few posts
I will cover the [toto] engine that this is running on and the whole process of setting up Ruby on my
Windows machine (which was a <del>nightmare</del> fun experience).

Stay tuned!
