Hidden away in plain sight about 2 hours northwest of Oklahoma City, Gloss Mountain State Park is a welcome change to the fields and farms you drive past to get there. It's hard to believe you are still in Oklahoma when you get close because the mountain range is a beautiful collection of mesas in the middle of the plains.

After a short hike from the valley to the top of Cathedral Mountain, you can
walk around the top and take in the amazing views.

If you pay attention, some of the wildlife will follow you. Not sure on the
type; I'm guessing they were some type of hawk though.

It was early in the year, but there was still some vegetation at the top.
Flowers were about to start blooming.

It wouldn't be a trip in Oklahoma without a picture of oil rigs.

When you get to the end of the trail, you encounter a fence with a sign
containing an ominous warning.

Altogether a great little trail with some amazing views. Whether you're going
out to take pictures or not, I recommend taking a short trip out to Gloss
Mountain State Park to relax and take in some views.

## Notes

In hindsight I should have used ISO 100 film instead of 400 for this shoot, as it was hard to
keep the exposure correct. I now have some Kodak Ektar 100 film to try out for
my next outdoor shoot.
